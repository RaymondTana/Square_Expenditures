This page helps you set up your Gmail for the tool. None of your information is saved while using this tool.

# Prerequisites

The tool expects that you receive Square receipts to a Gmail address. The emails detected in this app will be any from the sender: `messenger@messaging.squareup.com`. In order to access your mailboxes, you will need both:

1. Your Gmail address (e.g., `user@gmail.com`)
2. An "App Password" (e.g. `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

## Get an App Password for your Gmail Account

An app password is a 16-character passcode that gives a less secure app or device permission to access your Google Account. App passwords can only be used with accounts that have 2-Step Verification turned on.

Click here to [create and manage your app passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords). You will likely be required to sign into your Google Account. You can fill in anything for the "App name". Afterwards, click `Create`. You may now copy the App Password that's been created and paste it into the appropriate field on the `Tool` tab.

Note that if you’ve set up 2-Step Verification but can’t find the option to add an app password, it might be because:
- Your Google Account has 2-Step Verification set up only for security keys.
- You’re logged into a work, school, or another organization account.
- Your Google Account has Advanced Protection.
